# Predicting Thin-Film Thickness from X-ray Reflectivity (XRR)


## Overview
This project generates synthetic XRR-like curves for a single thin film
and trains a machine learning model to predict film thickness.

## The goal is to learn:
- Python basics
- Supervised machine learning
- How inverse problems appear in materials science

## Method
- Synthetic XRR curves with Kiessig fringes
- Log-scaled reflectivity as input features
- Random Forest regression model

## Results
The model predicts film thickness with mean absolute error of ~X nm
on synthetic test data.

## Requirements
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
